/*    Class - Real-Life Analogy:

    Think of a class as a blueprint for building a house. This blueprint defines the general structure of the house,
    including the number of rooms, their layout, the types of doors and windows, and other architectural details. However,
    the blueprint itself is not a house; it's just a plan for creating houses. Each house built using this blueprint will
     share these common characteristics but can have its own unique details such as paint colors, furniture, and decorations.

    Class - Programming Explanation:

    In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class serves as a template or blueprint for creating objects (instances).
     A class defines properties (often called attributes or fields which is also called variables) and methods (functions)
     that its objects will have. These are called members of the class!

     However, the class itself is just a definition, not a tangible entity in your program. Only when you create an instance
     (or object) of that class does it take on a "life" of its own in the program's memory.

    public class Car {

        // Attributes or Fields

        String color;

        String model;

        int speed;

        // Methods

        void accelerate() {
            speed += 10;
        }

        void brake() {
            speed -= 10;
        }

    }*/
